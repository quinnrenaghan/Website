For this project, I worked alongside 5 other QUEST honors students to improve the detector tracking process at UMD Radiation Facilities.

UMD Radiation Facilities is home to a nuclear reactor, a panoramic irridiator, and a linear accelerator. As a result, they are required by law to have 8 different types of radiation detectors, and calibrate them annually. To calibrate the detectors, Radiation Facilities (RF) sends the detectors to the UMD Radiation Safety Office (RSO), who then send them to a 3rd party vendor. Along the way, the detectors are often lost or misplaced, which forces the department to purchase new detectors, costing $2,000 dollars each on average. Thus, our opportunity was to **streamline the detector tracking process** to prevent loss of equipment and reduce time spent logging detector data.

The consultation began with research and stakeholder interviews, which helped us become familiar with the Google Sheet that the department previously used for tracking, and informed the creation of our initial process flow diagram. Then, by identifying pain points in the current process, such as repeated manual entry and lack of reminders, we focused in on areas of inefficiency or waste that we believed could be improved.

Next, we met with RSO, where we were surprised to learn about an existing dynamic database, and their detector loaning system. This, along with our previous research and analysis, led us to our recommendations:

- Utilize the existing RSO dynamic detector database for tracking

- Update the database with a reminder system and automated detector logging

- Clearly label Radiation Facilities detectors to prevent misplacement and unauthorized external loaning

- Establish communication channels with RSO for clarification on detector statuse


With these improvements, RF can eliminate the losses of detectors, saving them approximately $6,000 annually. In addition, through increased automation and efficiency, beta testing showed that RF employees should see a 66% decrease in time spent on detector tracking.

To close out the consultation, we presented our findings and recommendations at a poster session. Our poster is shown below.
