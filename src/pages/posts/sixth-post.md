I have used Eclipse for almost 2 years now. Everytime I use it, it disappoints me in some major way. Here are some of the biggest problems with Eclipse:

## 1. The UI

The Eclipse UI looks and feels like it was made in the stone-age. Aside from its poor appearance, it freezes constantly, shows incorrect status messages, and is impossible to navigate.

I’ll never understand why the settings and controls in Eclipse are arranged the way they are. If you look in the intuitive place for an option, you won’t find it, because it’s buried under three or four drop-downs in a completely unrelated part of the menu.  

- "Install new software" at the bottom of the "Help" menu? Brilliant GUI design!

- Want to change from dark theme to light theme? That'll take 30 minutes, 10 google searches, and 3 Eclipse restarts.

## 2. The Auto-Complete

The Eclipse autocomplete is consistently slow, sometimes stupid, and often completely non-existent. It’s always faster to just type out the code rather than waiting for Eclipse to catch up. 

Also, it has a habit of stealing focus (a common issue in Eclipse).

```java
Foo bar = new Foo();
bar.
```
Still waiting...

Other tools, like IntelliJ, have fast, smart, and reliable code feedback features, which can save you considerable time. These features are better at predicting and completing lines, recognizing and solving problems, and formatting on the fly.

## 3. The Slow Speed, Crashing and Hanging

In general, Eclipse feels bloated, unstable, and fragile. 

- Every click seems delayed, like you're playing an online video game with high ping

- The programs regularly crashes due to internal errors

- Opening projects, especially large ones, can take minutes

- Cancelling tasks makes Eclipse hang and take longer than it would have taken to let the task finish

-  Eclipse is known to be resource intensive, which means developers will need decent hardware to avoid even slower speeds

## 4. Everything is a Plug-in

Eclipse is pratically a plug-in delivery system. Almost everything is a plug-in: the text rendering, the menus, themes, linting, etc. 

It’s like building a bike out of legos, it might be great that all of the pieces are interchangable and easy to swap in and out, but the end result is inefficient because none of the pieces perform their job as well as a specially designed part.

## 5. The Steep Learning Curve

Now, I’m aware that many of the above issues could be resolved by someone more experienced with Eclipse. However, as the IDE has so many options and features, it can be difficult for novice developers to find the specific trick needed to solve an issue. 

For example, I just figured out last week that there is a "save automatically before build" option hidden away in Eclipse preferences. 

With enough configuration and plugins, Eclipse can become nearly equivalent to other IDEs, but who has time for that? In my opinion, an ideal product would work out of the box, not take years to become passable.

In summary, if you aren't forced to use Eclipse by your employer or university, don't. This small decision will save you hours, valuable time that could be spent working on a project. Use IntelliJ, NetBeans, VS Code - anything else.
